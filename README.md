# DSI-Capstone-Forcasting Oil Price and Consumption 

## Background 
### Question: 
->Would Paris agreement reduce oil price and consumption?

#### Assumptions:
Oil consumption:
Gradual decrease. 

Oil price:
Increase in price. 

## Data
### Oil price

### Oil consumtion

## Steps 
For both time series do the following:

Then Apply time series models and choose the one with the lowest Residual, here I applied four models which are:

## Findings
### Oil price

### Oil consumtion

## Conclusion 
In conslusion these forcasting plots are according to what we are having right now. However, If a unexpected event happend like the pandamic the future would be diffrent. Also, if any political issues happened between the countries oil price and consumption would be affected.
